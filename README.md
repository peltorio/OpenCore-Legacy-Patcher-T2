             <h1>OpenCore Legacy Patcher for T2 Macs</h1>
</div>

A Python-based project revolving around [Acidanthera's OpenCorePkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg) and [Lilu](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu) for both running and unlocking features in macOS on supported and unsupported Macs.

> **⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL FORK** — Adds **macOS 15 Sequoia and macOS 26 Tahoe support for T2 Macs**. T2 Macs as of now are unsupported by the official OpenCore Legacy Patcher from Dortania. Use it at your own risk. It's still in alpha stage, so I highly recommend to backup all your data and do it only on a spare T2 Mac to experiment.
## T2 Mac Support

> **⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH** — This branch is considered pre-alpha. Since upgrading to OpenCore 1.0.7 is very sensitive process, it will become mainstream alpha when considered fully stable.

> **🚧 Not ready for general use**

**Progress:**
- [x] USB installer drive is detected
- [X] Installer boots to the setup screen - MacBook Air 2020 may require more patches to be able to boot the installer; to boot the installer on the 2018-2020 MacBook Pro and the 2018 Mac mini; you need to disable Secure Boot and then disable SIP via csrutil disable and csrutol-authenticated-boot disable.

- [🛑] macOS boots properly - it says "macOS Tahoe" is not compatible to your Mac.

This branch is designed exactly to fix this issue.
- [🛑] all devices (including USB, GPU etc) is working - WiFi and USB is confirmed working on the 2018 Mac mini; GPU accelaration on macOS 26 Tahoe is still early to say because I can't manage to install macOS 26 Tahoe yet.

Our goal of this project is to add support for T2 Macs so unsupported T2 Macs can boot into Sequoia and Tahoe. This project may run on non-T2 Macs, but support is limited for those and that's not the focus of this project.

----------

Noteworthy features of OpenCore Legacy Patcher:

* Support for macOS Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma, Sequoia and eventually add support for Tahoe.
* Native Over the Air (OTA) System Updates
* Supports Penryn and newer Macs
* Full support for WPA Wi-Fi and Personal Hotspot on BCM943224 and newer wireless chipsets
* System Integrity Protection, FileVault 2, .im4m Secure Boot and Vaulting
* Recovery OS, Safe Mode and Single-user Mode booting on non-native OSes
* Unlocks features such as Sidecar and AirPlay to Mac even on native Macs
* Enables enhanced SATA and NVMe power management on non-Apple storage devices
* Zero firmware patching required (ie. APFS ROM patching)
* Graphics acceleration for both Metal and non-Metal GPUs

----------

Note: Only clean-installs and upgrades are supported. macOS Big Sur installs already patched with other patchers, such as [Patched Sur](https://github.com/BenSova/Patched-Sur) or [bigmac](https://github.com/StarPlayrX/bigmac), cannot be used due to broken file integrity with APFS snapshots and SIP.

* You can, however, reinstall macOS with this patcher and retain your original data

Note 2: Currently, OpenCore Legacy Patcher officially supports patching to run macOS Big Sur through Sonoma installs. For older OSes, OpenCore may function; however, support is currently not provided from Dortania.

* For macOS Mojave and Catalina support, we recommend the use of [dosdude1's patchers](http://dosdude1.com)
